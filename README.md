# üìù Week 3 Lab - HTML About Me Page

A template repostiory for practicing HTML by creating an informational page about yourself using standard HTML boilerplate and tags.

## Goal

Students can build a single webpage demonstrating their understanding of the following HTML tags:

* `<html>`
* `<meta>`
* `<head>`
* `<title>`
* `<body>`
* `<h1>`
* `<p>`
* `<strong>`
* `<em>`
* `<ul>`
* `<ol>`
* `<li>`
* `<a>`
* `<img>`

We'll also look for the following:

* a `lang` attribute is added to their `<html>` declaration
* a `charset` attribute is added to their `<meta>` declaration
* all `<img>` tags have an `alt` attribute

## Instructions

### Create an HTML page about yourself

The first step will be to fork this repository to your own account and then open it up in a Codespace.

Create an HTML webpage about yourself (or anything, really) that uses a proper HTML boilerplate and uses the following tags.

* Use the correct [HTML boilerplate](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate)
  * Doctype
    * HTML5 doctype
  * `<html>` element
    * `lang` attribute
  *  `<head>` element
    *  `charset`
    *  `<title>`
  * `<body>` element
* Paragraphs (`<p>`)
* Headings (`<h1>`)
* Strong elements (`<strong>`)
* Ordered and Unordered lists (`<ul>` and `<ol>`)
* An image (`<img>`)

For a reference listing the different HTML tags, check out: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element

### Add your page to the class webpage

Bonus material, if you have time!

* Clone or open up a Codespace to the class webpage
* Create a working branch
* Create a new file in the `bios` directory with the name of your GitHub username
* Alter the `index.html` page to add a link to the bio page you just created
* Push the branch to the repository
* Create a pull request and have the pull request reviewed
* Merge pull request to `main`

## Assignment Grading

This assignment uses automated tests to check for the presence of the required HTML tags. You can run the tests by running:

```bash
rake test
```

## Viewing Your Webpage

We've installed a tiny webserver in the development container so you can view your webpage. It should start up when you open the project in its container, or in a Codespace
